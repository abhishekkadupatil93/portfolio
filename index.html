        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a full stack software professional with over <strong>6+ years of experience</strong>
            in web application development primarily within the <strong>BFSI domain</strong>.
            I am currently working as a <strong>Consultant</strong> at Mindcraft Softwares Pvt. Ltd.,
            where I am assigned the role of <strong>Team Lead</strong> for a client engagement with
            SBI Life Insurance.
        </p>

        <p>
            I began my career as a Java trainee at Clover Infotech Pvt. Ltd., where I was assigned
            to Bajaj Finserv. After a year, I was promoted to Software Engineer and continued my
            association with Clover for nearly four years. During this period, I spent over
            three years working with Bajaj Finserv and BHFL and later transitioned to SBI Life Insurance
            for a new engagement. Following this, I moved to Mindcraft Softwares Pvt. Ltd. on the
            recommendation of my client, where I was retained as a Consultant with team lead
            responsibilities. I have been associated with SBI Life Insurance for the past three
            years through Mindcraft.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout my career, I have worked across the complete software development lifecycle,
            starting from requirement understanding and design to development, deployment and
            production support. My technical journey began with Java and expanded to include
            JavaScript, jQuery, and Oracle WebCenter Sites as a CMS platform, along with exposure
            to Linux environments, application servers and system architecture. I have also been
            actively involved in stakeholder communication across technical and business teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            From a leadership perspective, I have handled key ownership roles at client sites.
            At Bajaj Finserv, I worked as a Vertical Lead for the B2B module, leading a team of
            five members. Later, at SBI Life Insurance, I was entrusted with the role of Team Lead
            for a team of ten members. My responsibilities included technical decision-making,
            delivery ownership, mentoring team members and regular coordination with senior
            stakeholders including Managers, AVPs, VPs and SVPs. Based on my performance and
            ownership, I was retained by SBI Life Insurance through Mindcraft.
        </p>

        <p>
            Technically, I have a strong command over Oracle WebCenter Sites, including solution
            design, frontend UX integration and Spring-based backend development. I also possess
            a good understanding of enterprise server architecture, databases, WebLogic servers
            and Solr-based applications. I focus on building stable, maintainable, and scalable
            solutions aligned with business objectives.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to technical delivery, I bring a strong client and business orientation.
            I have worked closely with product owners, business analysts, managers and senior
            leadership. I was also part of a critical SBI Life Insurance initiative that
            contributed to the organization achieving a Guinness World Record. Across all my
            engagements, I have consistently demonstrated ownership and accountability for the
            solutions I deliver.
        </p>

        <p>
            At this stage of my career, I am looking to transition into <strong>higher leadership
            roles</strong> such as Assistant Manager or Manager, where I can take on broader
            responsibilities, lead larger teams and contribute to challenging initiatives that
            offer long-term growth and impact.
